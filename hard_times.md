# Hard times - IN PRGOGRESS

This essay will be about the hard times, what they are and what might be able
to do about them when they inevitably arrive. Why am I even bothering to
write about this? Multiple reasons really. Encountered them many times and
each time I have felt the same things over and over again. That there is
nothing I can do about the situation and this would inevitably put me down.
Turning a difficult time of life into an excrutiating one. Secondly, I believe
everybody else has to suffer/struggle with difficulties at some point in their
lives. My personal battle against the corrupting influences of the struggle
which charactirizes ordinary life are made that much more bearable if at least
through the sharing of my pain I can alleviate someone elses. Moreover, what
I have noticed, regretfully only recently, is that pain/suffering, as any
other negative emotion for that matter, is made that much more harder when
faced alone. A single willing, emphatic listener can change your whole
outlook on the situation. Thirdly, for the longest time I had the urge to
write about what I am thinking about. Waited for the "good enough" too long
and my ability to express ideas haven't improved in the least. Thus I would
not be able to write what I need to whenever I need, because I don't know how.
Here we are as always, selfish reasons mixed in with altruisic ones. This is
what I have learned about hard times.
