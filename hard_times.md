# Hard times - IN PRGOGRESS

This essay will be about the hard times, what they are and what one might be able to do about them when they inevitably arrive. Why am I even bothering to
write about this? Multiple reasons really. Encountered them many times and
each time I have felt the same things over and over again. That there is
nothing I can do about the situation and this would inevitably put me down.
Loose hope, and with hope I would be lost. Sometimes turning trivial issues
into multiple days of suffering.
Turning a difficult time of life into an excruciating one. Secondly, I believe
everybody else has to suffer/struggle with difficulties at some point in their
lives. My personal battle against the corrupting influences of the struggle
which characterizes ordinary life are made that much more bearable if at least
through the sharing of my pain I can alleviate someone else's. Moreover, what
I have noticed, regretfully only recently, is that pain/suffering, as any
other negative emotion for that matter, is made that much more harder when
faced alone. A single willing, emphatic listener can change your whole
outlook on the situation. Thirdly, the material I have encountered so far on
the internet during these times, mainly motivational videos are good to get
the person out from the depths, but aren't good enough to keep things moving
sustainably or perhaps even more importantly, to help someone grow the
strength to actually deal with the issues causing the pain.
Fourthly, for the longest time I had the urge to
write about what I am thinking about. Waited for the "good enough" too long
and my ability to express ideas haven't improved in the least. Thus I would
not be able to write what I need to whenever I need, because I don't know how.
Here we are as always, selfish reasons mixed in with altruistic ones. This is
what I have learned about hard times.

Alright what do I mean by hard times? For now lets say, the times in your life
when you knew perfectly well that something isn't alright and you felt hurt
about it and you either knew what you should do, but didn't have the energy or
faith to do it, or you had no idea what should be done. We can group them
temporally lasting a few hours, days or years and a grouping can be made for
their source be it physical or mental.

|source/time-frame|short|long|
|---|---|---|
|physical|a marathon|burns|
|mental|waiting for the doctor to call back|depression, traumas|


### Short physical

The simplest one to handle are the short physical ones. These can be hard
trainings or a race like a marathon. During these one can experience a lot of
pain, but because their source is physical in nature, hence the mind is
usually stable during them, they seem to be the easiest to control. Unless
one pushes the limits enough, so much so that even the mind starts to cave
in. They appear as doubts and an unending stream of increasingly more
elaborate reasons produced by our minds, trying to make us to stop doing
whatever we are doing at the moment.

Some doubts:

- "Well I don't think this makes sense, let's just stop. You will just get
injured."
- "What were you thinking! You won't be able to do it anyways. Why bother?"
- My personal favorite: "Why am I even doing this?"

Reasons to stop:

- "You have to go buy groceries, clean the house, you better start working on
those."
- "Listen, I know you have decided to reward yourself with a coffee after
your training. You did enough, how about we just stop a little sooner and
enjoy that coffee?"
- "Well if you don't push yourself too much now, go home and relax a bit. Go
to bed a little earlier than usual, you will be able to perform better the
next time. Hmmm, what do you think? That makes perfect sense right?"

Tackling them is relatively easy in one sense and hard on the other. Until the
mind isn't affected it is just a matter of perseverance with respect to our
bodies. One must start humbly, not trying to push things too hard too fast.
Your mind is rebelling with a reason. It doesn't know how much you can take
and it wants to protect you. Work with it. Don't try to tyrannize it and you
will soon find that it starts to cooperate with you. You have planned a 10 km
run, but feel like dirt before it. You start running and you feel like dirt
doing it. Do 3 km and go home. Do not force yourself. Your might be too
tired, emotionally drained, stressed to do more. That is okay. Do a little and
try not to feel bad about it. Hey, you did a little. That is more than
nothing. If you keep that little up it will take you to places. Zero will take
you nowhere.

It becomes hard during a race you have been training for as there is no
escape from the physical pain and after a while it will affect the mind as
well. For example during a marathon. Depending on how well you have prepared
for it, how sick, stressed you are the experience can go sideways really
fast. One leg starts to cramp, then the other, your knew feels like it is
gonna explode any moment.
