Topic: How to handle hard times?

## Reading list and notes

After struggling to write a few lines about hard times I have realized that there is much more left to be said about the topic and what I have done is nothing more but a superficial scratch on the surface. What I have for the moment is true and rings true to me, but now it seems evident there is not much more to say. Well, it is alright. The first time I have ever embarked on this journey, it is supposed to be difficult. Non the less the question interests me greatly and the work has to be done.
To do a good job of the task at hand I have referred to the essay writing guidelines at [Essay Writing Guide](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://jordanbpeterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Essay_Writing_Guide.docx). This has illuminated me to the fact that I have no idea how to write properly and that I should read a bit more about the topic, so that I have something to actually say.
First task is to collect the information. Listed a few books below that have already inspired me and some that should be read and understood fully. What doing this has shown me is that I seem to have accidentally started attacking the problem from every side. The Psychological aspects, offering solutions from our understanding of human behavior, Military aspects or how a modern warrior would handle life. Lastly from a Religious aspect. Based on generational knowledge and wisdom that seems to have been lost in the modern world. Discarded for facts and proofs, however they might be more important now than ever to glue humanities fractured knowledge into one coherent whole.

In any case I have no idea yet what I am rambling about, but one thing seems to be certain. There seems to be no single solution and to me that seems to indicate that we haven't understood something as a species just yet. Most likely the truth we seek is at the point where all, especially conflicting ideas intersect.

Write some notes, then outlines.

### Psychological

#### 12 Rules for Life - Jordan B. Peterson

#### In the realm of hungry ghosts - Gábor Máté

The book focuses on addiction and how it occurs. May that be addiction to hard drugs like cocaine, methamphetamines or commonly accepted ones like alcohol, caffeine and recently marihuana. Or and this was a shock to me or even a revelation perhaps, people can get addicted to patterns of behaviors as well, like working, sports, sex. The author himself admits being addicted to buying classical music by the truckload, whether he already owned 3-4 separate versions of the same symphonies or not. How he was addicted to working nonstop.
Even more importantly it is shown in meticulous detail, that addiction is affected by the development of the person from the moment of conception. That everything affecting the mother during pregnancy will affect the child, everything during the first few years of the child's maturation will have a lasting impact on the resulting behavioral patterns. The developing brain will compensate/adapt for the pressures and impacts that the environment is exerting on it.
Many examples are given by the author what an early event what kind of impact can have on a person. Two of these have stayed with me as I think we can all relate to these if we allow ourselves to observe them, for it is almost without question that we have experienced one of them at least throughout our lives, even as adults.
A baby is crying in its crib for whatever reason. If it isn't attended to for around 3 days, when it cries for support, it will stop doing so altogether. Being so profoundly vulnerable, and begging for help while being completely incapable of doing anything about the situation hurts so deeply that the only way the psyche sees to protect itself is shut down the feelings altogether. To push them down, to compartmentalize them and box them away into the dark recesses of the mind. The justification being, if it hurts too much to feel, so much so that is is crushing you, it is better not feel at all. I don't think any of us have to think too hard or too long about a situation when we have felt completely powerless and the best we have managed to do was to ignore the issue, the feelings altogether.
The second example Gábor has raised was about his workaholism. As a baby being born in 1944 to Jewish parents in Hungary 2 months before Nazi occupation his life had a rough start. To save his life her mother smuggled him out of the ghetto while he was only 12 months old. The separation from his mother, the stresses that he had endured as a small child affected him deeply. His sense of self worth suffered greatly. He had an extremely hard time receiving love on an emotional level. Not that he didn't receive any, his foster parents loved and took care of him, he was incapable of receiving it. However the need for being loved is in all of us and it is not something one can live without. To compensate for the void of not feeling loved he made himself indispensible by becoming a very hard working doctor. If they need me, if they rely on me to help them, then I must be valuable even though I don't experience the feeling inside. Since the internal void cannot be filled by external events, but the external events sooth the internal pain, the cycle of addiction continues and when the external source diminishes the internal pain bubbles up. In his words: "Like any addict, I used my addictions to help regulate my moods, my internal experience. On weekends when the beeper fell silent I felt empty and irritable-the addict in withdrawal.". How many of us have experienced something similar? When we work, when we do something we like or sometimes we don't even like we are more or less stable and fine, but the moment the external stimuli is gone and we are left alone with ourselves and the demons we try so desperately to suppress come back with a vengeance.
Addiction is not just a result of a psychological process going haywire. It is the result of actual physical change in our brains. A change that is mostly affected by the environment. Genes do play a part, but not a significant one. "Not only is there no addiction gene, there couldn't be one.", there are just to few genes to code for everything. Professor Robert Sapolsky also demonstrates in his [Human Behavioral Biology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D) course that genes can have wildly different effects based on the environment.
These observations are rather profound. To be honest they even look bleak. There seems to be no escape. If your brain has physically changed, what is there for you to do?
The author although doesn't propose a solution, he demonstrates that force, violence and retribution is not a way for helping. The war on drugs has failed on many accounts and there is no evidence for it's efficacy. On the other hand programs where patients were allowed to inject free drugs in a safe environment have been tremendously successful. The rates of infections, overdoses have plummeted. And by relieving the addict of the burden of collecting enough money to fuel his addiction, they have excess resources to try and put themselves back together. Others didn't became addicts who weren't previously ones. It wasn't a gateway to the lifestyle. No healthy person wants to be shunned and rejected by society so they can have a few minutes of joy, if their lives are in order.
What about other addictions? Workaholism or sports? They are insidious in a sense that society is actively rewarding these behaviors as well. What can we do then?
Something analogous to the compassionate approach towards hard drug users should be how one approaches themselves. One has to be allowed again to feel, to accept having the needs long suppressed so the being can come back together into the unity it was meant to be in.
Somehow whenever I think of these issues, whenever emotions come up that I try to suppress I remember the quote: "Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding." - Albert Einstein
Not sure to what he has formulated this sentence, but is seems true when applied in this sense as well.

### Military

#### Can't hurt me - David Goggins

#### Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and win - Jocko Willink, Leif Babin

### Religion

#### Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu

#### The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are - Alan Watts

# Essay

This essay will be about the hard times, what they are and what one might be able to do about them when they inevitably arrive. Why am I even bothering to
write about this? Multiple reasons really. Encountered them many times and
each time I have felt the same things over and over again. That there is
nothing I can do about the situation and this would inevitably put me down.
Loose hope, and with hope I would be lost. Sometimes turning trivial issues
into multiple days of suffering.
Turning a difficult time of life into an excruciating one. Secondly, I believe
everybody else has to suffer/struggle with difficulties at some point in their
lives. My personal battle against the corrupting influences of the struggle
which characterizes ordinary life are made that much more bearable if at least
through the sharing of my pain I can alleviate someone elses. Moreover, what
I have noticed, regretfully only recently, is that pain/suffering, as any
other negative emotion for that matter, is made that much more harder when
faced alone. A single willing, emphatic listener can change your whole
outlook on the situation. Thirdly, the material I have encountered so far on
the internet during these times, mainly motivational videos are good to get
the person out from the depths, but aren't good enough to keep things moving
sustainably or perhaps even more importantly, to help someone grow the
strength to actually deal with the issues causing the pain.
Fourthly, for the longest time I had the urge to
write about what I am thinking about. Waited for the "good enough" too long
and my ability to express ideas haven't improved in the least. Thus I would
not be able to write what I need to, whenever I need to, because I don't know how
to.
Here we are as always, selfish reasons mixed in with altruistic ones. This is
what I have learned about hard times.

## What are "hard times"

Alright what do I mean by hard times? For now lets say, the times in your life
when you knew perfectly well that something isn't alright and you felt hurt
about it and you either knew what you should do, but didn't have the energy or
faith to do so, or you had no idea what should be done. Depending on your
personality. To which category your specific situation belongs all depends on who
you are. Your past, your personality, your actual mood all affect how you
perceive the given situation. An event for one might look like the end of the
world if it manifests itself at an inopportune time, while to someone else it
might just be a bump in the road completely forgotten in about 15 minutes.
To make the abstract more tangible, the meta more real, I believe a few examples
are in order.

Maybe you are in school. There is nothing about it you like expect for a few
classes, but mostly you feel oppressed. Why should I be told what to do and
anyways and who cares about this or that subject? Is there anything I can do
about it? Not really. Everybody has to go to school, everybody has to get
educated, my parents are on my tail non stop to produce better grades. I feel
powerless to do anything, but to comply. My gut on the other hand is telling me
that this is wrong and something should be done about it, but I have no idea
about what to do.

You wake up in the morning, perhaps every morning and you realize that well, not
much reason do you see to get out of the bed. You ponder about it a little and
start asking the questions. How come I feel this way? Don't I like my job? What
has happened to me? Time passes with the questions and you suddenly realize well
you have no time for this, there are about a million things to do today. Go work,
train, walk the dog, cook something and the list goes on and on. While you are
busy living your "life" your mind has no time for more questions and the issue
seems to go away, but the next morning eventually comes and you wake up again.
You still have no idea what is wrong, but you are a little tired now. A little
less motivated and eventually you might even get used to it, to the point of even
forgetting the original question. The bugging problem seems to vanish, but
somehow things still seem hard.

Found the love of your life. Spent a few beautiful years together, working trough
your issues and trying to make each other better. You have your first child and
you are elated thinking about the future and the bright possibilities it might
hold. Then one uneventful day you get a call from the police or hospital telling
you that your partner and child have both died in a fatal car accident. In a
single second your past, your present and your future are completely obliterated.
Suddenly there is no up or down, left or right, nothing but a void you can't
imagine could ever be filled.

Perhaps you have an addiction. You drink alcohol or coffee, you smoke or do
something less obvious. Your obsession might be work, you just work too much. 60
hours or more maybe per week. Possibly you eat sweets a lot, especially when you
get stressed. On top of this you know your issue is present. You know perfectly
well that smoking a pack a day is ruining your health, or getting drunk all the
time is a waste of time. Knowing the issue and knowing that you should stop,
doesn't seem to bring you closer to your salvation. There is simply nothing you
seem to be able to do about it.
