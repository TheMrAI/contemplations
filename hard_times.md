# Hard times - IN PRGOGRESS

This essay will be about the hard times, what they are and what one might be able to do about them when they inevitably arrive. Why am I even bothering to
write about this? Multiple reasons really. Encountered them many times and
each time I have felt the same things over and over again. That there is
nothing I can do about the situation and this would inevitably put me down.
Loose hope, and with hope I would be lost. Sometimes turning trivial issues
into multiple days of suffering.
Turning a difficult time of life into an excruciating one. Secondly, I believe
everybody else has to suffer/struggle with difficulties at some point in their
lives. My personal battle against the corrupting influences of the struggle
which characterizes ordinary life are made that much more bearable if at least
through the sharing of my pain I can alleviate someone elses. Moreover, what
I have noticed, regretfully only recently, is that pain/suffering, as any
other negative emotion for that matter, is made that much more harder when
faced alone. A single willing, emphatic listener can change your whole
outlook on the situation. Thirdly, the material I have encountered so far on
the internet during these times, mainly motivational videos are good to get
the person out from the depths, but aren't good enough to keep things moving
sustainably or perhaps even more importantly, to help someone grow the
strength to actually deal with the issues causing the pain.
Fourthly, for the longest time I had the urge to
write about what I am thinking about. Waited for the "good enough" too long
and my ability to express ideas haven't improved in the least. Thus I would
not be able to write what I need to, whenever I need to, because I don't know how
to.
Here we are as always, selfish reasons mixed in with altruistic ones. This is
what I have learned about hard times.

Alright what do I mean by hard times? For now lets say, the times in your life
when you knew perfectly well that something isn't alright and you felt hurt
about it and you either knew what you should do, but didn't have the energy or
faith to do it, or you had no idea what should be done. We can group them
temporally lasting a few hours, days or years and a grouping can be made for
their source be it physical or mental.
