Topic: How to handle hard times?

## Reading list and notes

After struggling to write a few lines about hard times I have realized that there is much more left to be said about the topic and what I have done is nothing more but a superficial scratch on the surface. What I have for the moment is true and rings true to me, but now it seems evident there is not much more to say. Well, it is alright. The first time I have ever embarked on this journey, it is supposed to be difficult. Non the less the question interests me greatly and the work has to be done.
To do a good job of the task at hand I have referred to the essay writing guidelines at [Essay Writing Guide](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://jordanbpeterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Essay_Writing_Guide.docx). This has illuminated me to the fact that I have no idea how to write properly and that I should read a bit more about the topic, so that I have something to actually say.
First task is to collect the information. Listed a few books below that have already inspired me and some that should be read and understood fully. What doing this has shown me is that I seem to have accidentally started attacking the problem from every side. The Psychological aspects, offering solutions from our understanding of human behavior, Military aspects or how a modern warrior would handle life. Lastly from a Religious aspect. Based on generational knowledge and wisdom that seems to have been lost in the modern world. Discarded for facts and proofs, however they might be more important now than ever to glue humanities fractured knowledge into one coherent whole.

In any case I have no idea yet what I am rambling about, but one thing seems to be certain. There seems to be no single solution and to me that seems to indicate that we haven't understood something as a species just yet. Most likely the truth we seek is at the point where all, especially conflicting ideas intersect.

Write some notes, then outlines.

### Psychological

#### 12 Rules for Life An Antidote to Chaos - Jordan B. Peterson

I have read this book at least 4 times up to this point. 12 rules or more precisely guidelines have been presented by Jordan trying to help someone live a better life. I say they are better conceptualized as guidelines, because Jordan at no point suggests that they must be followed or that judgement will befall one if they are ignored. Although the second point can be assumed from the existence of the text itself.
The book in itself never mentions it, but if one watches Dr. Peterson long enough can learn that his goal is to construct his framework about the world and align the rules in such a way that they will act as a bulwark against the malevolence and the suffering that is inherent to existence itself.
The 12 rules are:

   1. Stand up straight with your shoulders back
   2. Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping
   3. Make friends with people who want the best for you
   4. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today
   5. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them
   6. Set your house in perfect order before your criticize the world
   7. Pursue what is meaningful not what is expedient
   8. Tell the truth - or, at least, don't lie
   9. Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't
   10. Be precise in your speech
   11. Do not bother children when they are skateboarding
   12. Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street

Rule 1 is about the importance of dominance hierarchies. It stipulates that the systems governing even our postural flexion, the serotonergic system, is so old that we share it with lobsters. This means that these systems in ourselves are older than are capability to recognize trees. For this reason one has to have their place in the dominance hierarchy somewhere. They have to have an occupation, otherwise they are lost and misguided.

Rule 2 makes a remark about the dichotomy between people acting towards other people, or pets for that matter, and themselves. People don't like themselves very much and we also know ourselves deeply and intimately. We know all our flaws, all our shortcomings and vile thoughts. So people will find hard to extend the same  kindness towards themselves that they would for someone else. The else is simple, but we are, man we are bad, I deserve my suffering, I have earned it. Jordan points out that organ transplant recipients have their bodies reject the organs they have been waiting for, sometimes for years, because they fail to administer their anti-rejection medication properly. However, when it comes to their dogs, cats or children, people would generally follow the prescriptions to the letter and administer the medicine fully.

Rule 3 is about the company one keeps. Do you have friends to whom you can share bad news with? Do you have friends to whom you can share good news with? Do your friends support you or are they trying to pull you back down, when you manifest a behavior that is pointing upwards? Let's say you want to quit smoking, but your friends are smokers. At a social gathering they would ask: "Don't you want to smoke one? Just relax and enjoy yourself.". By doing this they would slowly pressure you into the action you wish to avoid.
In other words they will put you down or pull you down. When you want to reach higher, they grab your leg and say no no no no, you come back here and stay with us, I don't want to feel bad about myself seeing you achieve greatness.
This is a harsh rule as it also says that those who do not act in a way that is supporting of your proper goals have to be discarded. We should stipulate proper, which is another question in itself, requiring a tremendous amount of self reflection and wisdom to even have a clue about. On the other hand at least we can say that one can stop doing things they know to be wrong and that will be a good first step.

Rule 4 is perhaps the most important rule of all, especially in this day and age of the interconnectedness we have. It is strikingly easy to choose any discipline, go online and find someone who is so extremely good at it, so much so that the hopes of ever achieving such platitudes are miniscule. Then one compares themselves with the unachievable and decide not to even try, or try timidly while constantly putting themselves down in comparison to the ideal.
Instead, we are much better off if we humble ourselves and accept our wretchedness with all it's shortcomings and follies. Then try to improve it day by day, step by step. It might take a while, but it will get somewhere and the miniscule improvements of each day will very soon start producing compound effects.
The rule doesn't express it explicitly, but we need peers to admire. People we can strive to be. So the problem isn't exactly with comparing yourself to someone else, but the way in which you do it. Admiring someone of great worth is not a tool to put yourself down, but more the realization of a value, represented in the world, that resonates with ones being, thus spurring the individual for imitation. It is a tool to learn about who we are, but it requires humility and a genuine care for oneself.

Rule 5 explains how important is to discipline your children. Or in other words to do something hard and painful, so that the one you love can become more. It points out that one can be a good person, but no matter how good one might be a monster lives inside as well. Keep that monster long enough in the dark while feeding it scraps of resentment, stress and hardships then an action on the child's part at an importunate time would wake it from it's slumber. Or more generally speaking. Either the inner monster is embraced and integrated, and we start acting in ways that keep it slumbering peacefully or there will be a price to be paid when it bursts out. Especially if we hurt our children in the process, the only parts of us that will live on even after we are gone.

Rule 6 is about humility or at least that seems to be the underlining narrative. One cannot wish to fix the injustices of the world if they cannot fix their own fallacies and shortcomings first. It is exceedingly easy to find the enemy outside, but it is all the more difficult to face the foes dwelling inside. The process of self reflection is a long and arduous process. It is not just about accepting our shortcomings, but facing them down one by one, hugging them close and letting them go. Dr. Peterson often says that parts of you have to die so the rest can go on and flourish. Letting those parts die is painful, especially because they were created and strengthened, even in their misguided/misshaped form, to protect us against the pain and suffering which are inevitable parts of life.

Rule 7 is a hard one to follow in todays world. Doing expedient things one after the other to sooth the inner pain cannot be easier. Buy something, drink something, buy something else, buy the new version of the thing you have and haven't realized it yet you need the new one. Go watch a movie, then have a fancy dinner, watch Netflix all day, because cleaning the house doesn't sound like fun. Then, at the end of the day feel bad, that nothing of value has been achieved and you know your life is going nowhere you wish it to go. That is what doing expedient things does. Shame and self loathing and ultimately the lack of meaning is the price. Meaningful things are hard, they take effort and sacrifice. In return however, when the night comes and there is nothing to distract you while you are watching the sealing laying on your back in the darkness, the questions "What am I doing with my life? Who am I? Why do I feel so empty?" won't haunt you. The things you do would not allow for these questions to even be formulated as the issues that would give rise to them aren't there any more.

Rule 8 is a nasty one. Telling the truth or not lying is no simple task. Not at all. The difficulty lies in what was already said in Rule 6. One must be able to be truthful with themselves first and foremost, they have to learn to watch and understand the opposing voices inside their minds and act on them when necessary. Not to shun them and push them down. A person who cannot stand up for themselves will shrink in the eyes of others and in theirs. A shrunken person, now learned in their incapability is doomed to repeatedly undermine their lives as long as they keep lying to themselves about what they need and deserve in life. Telling the truth is not just done for the sake of working with reality and not trying to bend it to our will, but it is for seeing the truth, to see the things as they are, because then, and only then can one do something about it.
"What saves is the willingness to learn from what you don't know." White lies, lies or any untruthful deed does nothing of value, but facilitates the avoidance of responsibly doing what we know needs to be done.

#### In the realm of hungry ghosts - Gábor Máté

The book focuses on addiction and how it occurs. May that be addiction to hard drugs like cocaine, methamphetamines or commonly accepted ones like alcohol, caffeine and recently marihuana. Or and this was a shock to me or even a revelation perhaps, people can get addicted to patterns of behaviors as well, like working, sports, sex. The author himself admits being addicted to buying classical music by the truckload, whether he already owned 3-4 separate versions of the same symphonies or not. How he was addicted to working nonstop.
Even more importantly it is shown in meticulous detail, that addiction is affected by the development of the person from the moment of conception. That everything affecting the mother during pregnancy will affect the child, everything during the first few years of the child's maturation will have a lasting impact on the resulting behavioral patterns. The developing brain will compensate/adapt for the pressures and impacts that the environment is exerting on it.
Many examples are given by the author what an early event what kind of impact can have on a person. Two of these have stayed with me as I think we can all relate to these if we allow ourselves to observe them, for it is almost without question that we have experienced one of them at least throughout our lives, even as adults.
A baby is crying in its crib for whatever reason. If it isn't attended to for around 3 days, when it cries for support, it will stop doing so altogether. Being so profoundly vulnerable, and begging for help while being completely incapable of doing anything about the situation hurts so deeply that the only way the psyche sees to protect itself is shut down the feelings altogether. To push them down, to compartmentalize them and box them away into the dark recesses of the mind. The justification being, if it hurts too much to feel, so much so that is is crushing you, it is better not feel at all. I don't think any of us have to think too hard or too long about a situation when we have felt completely powerless and the best we have managed to do was to ignore the issue, the feelings altogether.
The second example Gábor has raised was about his workaholism. As a baby being born in 1944 to Jewish parents in Hungary 2 months before Nazi occupation his life had a rough start. To save his life her mother smuggled him out of the ghetto while he was only 12 months old. The separation from his mother, the stresses that he had endured as a small child affected him deeply. His sense of self worth suffered greatly. He had an extremely hard time receiving love on an emotional level. Not that he didn't receive any, his foster parents loved and took care of him, he was incapable of receiving it. However the need for being loved is in all of us and it is not something one can live without. To compensate for the void of not feeling loved he made himself indispensible by becoming a very hard working doctor. If they need me, if they rely on me to help them, then I must be valuable even though I don't experience the feeling inside. Since the internal void cannot be filled by external events, but the external events sooth the internal pain, the cycle of addiction continues and when the external source diminishes the internal pain bubbles up. In his words: "Like any addict, I used my addictions to help regulate my moods, my internal experience. On weekends when the beeper fell silent I felt empty and irritable-the addict in withdrawal.". How many of us have experienced something similar? When we work, when we do something we like or sometimes we don't even like we are more or less stable and fine, but the moment the external stimuli is gone and we are left alone with ourselves and the demons we try so desperately to suppress come back with a vengeance.
Addiction is not just a result of a psychological process going haywire. It is the result of actual physical change in our brains. A change that is mostly affected by the environment. Genes do play a part, but not a significant one. "Not only is there no addiction gene, there couldn't be one.", there are just to few genes to code for everything. Professor Robert Sapolsky also demonstrates in his [Human Behavioral Biology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D) course that genes can have wildly different effects based on the environment.
These observations are rather profound. To be honest they even look bleak. There seems to be no escape. If your brain has physically changed, what is there for you to do?
The author although doesn't propose a solution, he demonstrates that force, violence and retribution is not a way for helping. The war on drugs has failed on many accounts and there is no evidence for it's efficacy. On the other hand programs where patients were allowed to inject free drugs in a safe environment have been tremendously successful. The rates of infections, overdoses have plummeted. And by relieving the addict of the burden of collecting enough money to fuel his addiction, they have excess resources to try and put themselves back together. Others didn't became addicts who weren't previously ones. It wasn't a gateway to the lifestyle. No healthy person wants to be shunned and rejected by society so they can have a few minutes of joy, if their lives are in order.
What about other addictions? Workaholism or sports? They are insidious in a sense that society is actively rewarding these behaviors as well. What can we do then?
Something analogous to the compassionate approach towards hard drug users should be how one approaches themselves. One has to be allowed again to feel, to accept having the needs long suppressed so the being can come back together into the unity it was meant to be in.
Somehow whenever I think of these issues, whenever emotions come up that I try to suppress I remember the quote: "Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding." - Albert Einstein
Not sure to what he has formulated this sentence, but is seems true when applied in this sense as well.

# Essay

This essay will be about the hard times, what they are and what one might be able to do about them when they inevitably arrive. Why am I even bothering to
write about this? Multiple reasons really. Encountered them many times and
each time I have felt the same things over and over again. That there is
nothing I can do about the situation and this would inevitably put me down.
Loose hope, and with hope I would be lost. Sometimes turning trivial issues
into multiple days of suffering.
Turning a difficult time of life into an excruciating one. Secondly, I believe
everybody else has to suffer/struggle with difficulties at some point in their
lives. My personal battle against the corrupting influences of the struggle
which characterizes ordinary life are made that much more bearable if at least
through the sharing of my pain I can alleviate someone elses. Moreover, what
I have noticed, regretfully only recently, is that pain/suffering, as any
other negative emotion for that matter, is made that much more harder when
faced alone. A single willing, emphatic listener can change your whole
outlook on the situation. Thirdly, the material I have encountered so far on
the internet during these times, mainly motivational videos are good to get
the person out from the depths, but aren't good enough to keep things moving
sustainably or perhaps even more importantly, to help someone grow the
strength to actually deal with the issues causing the pain.
Fourthly, for the longest time I had the urge to
write about what I am thinking about. Waited for the "good enough" too long
and my ability to express ideas haven't improved in the least. Thus I would
not be able to write what I need to, whenever I need to, because I don't know how
to.
Here we are as always, selfish reasons mixed in with altruistic ones. This is
what I have learned about hard times.

## What are "hard times"

Alright what do I mean by hard times? For now lets say, the times in your life
when you knew perfectly well that something isn't alright and you felt hurt
about it and you either knew what you should do, but didn't have the energy or
faith to do so, or you had no idea what should be done. Depending on your
personality. To which category your specific situation belongs all depends on who
you are. Your past, your personality, your actual mood all affect how you
perceive the given situation. An event for one might look like the end of the
world if it manifests itself at an inopportune time, while to someone else it
might just be a bump in the road completely forgotten in about 15 minutes.
To make the abstract more tangible, the meta more real, I believe a few examples
are in order.

Maybe you are in school. There is nothing about it you like expect for a few
classes, but mostly you feel oppressed. Why should I be told what to do and
anyways and who cares about this or that subject? Is there anything I can do
about it? Not really. Everybody has to go to school, everybody has to get
educated, my parents are on my tail non stop to produce better grades. I feel
powerless to do anything, but to comply. My gut on the other hand is telling me
that this is wrong and something should be done about it, but I have no idea
about what to do.

You wake up in the morning, perhaps every morning and you realize that well, not
much reason do you see to get out of the bed. You ponder about it a little and
start asking the questions. How come I feel this way? Don't I like my job? What
has happened to me? Time passes with the questions and you suddenly realize well
you have no time for this, there are about a million things to do today. Go work,
train, walk the dog, cook something and the list goes on and on. While you are
busy living your "life" your mind has no time for more questions and the issue
seems to go away, but the next morning eventually comes and you wake up again.
You still have no idea what is wrong, but you are a little tired now. A little
less motivated and eventually you might even get used to it, to the point of even
forgetting the original question. The bugging problem seems to vanish, but
somehow things still seem hard.

Found the love of your life. Spent a few beautiful years together, working trough
your issues and trying to make each other better. You have your first child and
you are elated thinking about the future and the bright possibilities it might
hold. Then one uneventful day you get a call from the police or hospital telling
you that your partner and child have both died in a fatal car accident. In a
single second your past, your present and your future are completely obliterated.
Suddenly there is no up or down, left or right, nothing but a void you can't
imagine could ever be filled.

Perhaps you have an addiction. You drink alcohol or coffee, you smoke or do
something less obvious. Your obsession might be work, you just work too much. 60
hours or more maybe per week. Possibly you eat sweets a lot, especially when you
get stressed. On top of this you know your issue is present. You know perfectly
well that smoking a pack a day is ruining your health, or getting drunk all the
time is a waste of time. Knowing the issue and knowing that you should stop,
doesn't seem to bring you closer to your salvation. There is simply nothing you
seem to be able to do about it.
