# The warrior's path - IN PROGRESS

Who is a warrior and what does it really mean to walk the path of the warrior?
Does it mean that one is ready for combat? To kill if neccessary or to fight
for something that is right?
Can one even say that war is a solution to any of our problems? What does
mean?

This essay will explore the topic and try to formulate an idea that
could be used as a guide. It is not the authors intention to put words into
anybodies mouth. Not to offer full fledged solutions or a ten step guide on
what one is supposed to do. However, it is one of the goals to collect
as much infomration about the topic as possible, work out the inconsistencies
then represent them in a clear and consise manner.

## Perspective

The essay itself is intended as a meditation for the writer itself. To help
him center his mind, find what he has lost and to possibly help a few fellow
souls along the way.
The answer the author is really after is more abtly phrased as: "What is the
meaning of life?". Life is ripe with suffering and catastrophies. A corsuary
look at history or at countries less fortunate, one can easily find thousands
upon thousands of souls taxed with neglect and deprivation so deep that what
we here in the modern world take for granted is a only a distant wish for
them.
Take a girl from Ghana living in Agbobloshie, wishing she could go and study.
Meanwhile in the modern world children generally hate school, see it as a
burden on existence.

A boy only wishing to see his father, yet here many who had the opportunity to
be raised by their parrents have accumulated a certain kind of resentment
towards them. When they no longer wish to even visit or talk with them unless
necessary.
This stark contrast between the goals and wishes of the downtrodden and the
one percent is astonishing. Many of us rarely had to suffer nearly as badly as
some of these people, yet the rates of suicide, depression, ADHD and all
hosts of mental and physycal disorders are rising.
What is there? What did the modern world loose while it became what it is?
The stark contrast between the perceived life of each individual within their
environments is perplexing. As if a person was capable of greatness
unimaginable under the right conditions with the necessary stimuly.
If nothing else this contrast, at least signifies that something of value has
been lost within the modern world.
Comparitively we are rich and powerfull beyond measure, yet our societies seem
to be helbent on devouring themselves. One cannot hear about anything
positive any longer. The news are saturated with outrage, one group or the
other getting offended about who knows what, continously trying to bring back
memories of oppressions of old.
As if our societies have lost the capacity for forgiveness and compassion.
What we have instead is virtue signalling and profit.

## What one needs

What do you need to brace yourself against the onslaught of pain and
suffering? According to Dr. Jordan B. Petterson what you need is meaning.
Something ultimately valuable for which you can fight for.
Dr. Gábor Máté seems to think one needs to be connected with their feelings.
That by accepting and understanding them, one can heal the generational
wounds of the past and become something more.
Alan Watts approaches the problem from a religious perspective. Building on
Buddhism and Taoism he is a proponent of letting go and focusing on the
present. In his view life is not a journey and should not be perceived as
such.
Which one of them is right? What should you do? What should you think?

What I believe that anybody who has been listened to and cherrished by
thousands has to have been right in some way or another. By combining what
they have each said we might arrive at an ultimate truth. Discarding any idea
just because it seems too foreing to us is a disservice not only to ourselves
, but to everybody around us.

It seems that one responsibility of the individual is to better itself in any
way possible. Why? Because life doesn't seem to be so simple to be about you
at all. It seems to be more about you within society, within your family,
withing your group of friends. One does not exist in a vacuum and cannot. By
interacting with other people we become ourselves and they become themselves.

## Notes

Alan Watts:

"That what I am involves who you are. I don't know who I am unless I know who
you are, and you don't know who you are unless you know who I am."
We define each other. Without one there is not the other.
