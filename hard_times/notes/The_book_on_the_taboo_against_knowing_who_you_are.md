# The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are - Alan Watts

## One - Inside information

The chapter is about how people have lost their ability to know themselves.
The real self. As if it became a taboo to talk about who a given individual is.
Alan shows that the purpose of religions at their core is to show us that the individual
is the manifestation of the divine. We as individuals, the animals around us, the trees
and the sky, the good and the bad are all God. He stipulates that this has been lost
throughout the ages, because people had to form groups of beliefs and when groups are
formed the goal changes from improving all to a perpetual game of one-upmanship. My
religion is more virtuous than yours etc.
Not to mention that modern individuals can't even comprehend the archaic texts, with
outdated examples and stories.

Without the redeeming nature of religion, of the belief in a higher good and value, the
individual is left with nothing but the realization that they are nothing more than little
tubes putting food in one end and excreting the result at another end. The tube make other
tubes so when their inevitable death finally arrives they don't fully disappear.

> Our generation knows a cold hell, solitary confinement in this life, without a God to
damn or save it. Until man figures out the trap and hunts ... "the Ultimate Ground of
Being," he has no reason at all for his existence. Empty, finite, he knows only that he
will soon die. Since this life has no meaning, and he sees no future life, he is not
really a person but a victim of self-extinction. - T. George Harris

I think that, just that paragraph alone describes everything that is wrong in the world
today.

Although religion is very important to the author he points out that there is no single
good answer and more importantly, even the pursuit for finding such an answer is false.

> Irrevocable commitment to any religion is not only intellectual suicide; it is positive
unfaith because it closes the mind to any new vision of the world. Faith is, above all,
open-ness -- an act of trust in the unknown.

## Two - The game of black and white

Light and dark are necessary as without one there can be no other. This notion is
something many nowadays are familiar with. Alan argues that this isn't the end of the
story. They aren't just necessary to each other to exist they are
one thing. We just find it difficult to comprehend the unity, because we live (light) and
we die (dark). Death is something that we are raised/built to avoid. It inevitably becomes
something bad, something to be avoided. Therefore our lives turn into the metaphorical
battle between light and dark. Whatever may come light must win.

But with this approach we miss the big picture. Our minds get stuck being narrowly focused
on the parts without seeing the whole. Attention, similarly to life and death, necessitates
ignorance. One can only attend to somethings if others are ignored.

Life is full of wonders if ones allows themselves to see.

> Real travel requires a maximum of unscheduled wandering, for there is no other way of
discovering surprises and marvels, which, as I see it, is the only good reason for not
staying at home.

Yes, it is dangerous to go outside, but it is just as dangerous to stay at home and do
nothing. With an apt example Alan demonstrates what it is to be afraid of death:

> Indeed, you were kicked off the edge of a precipice when you were born, and it's no help
to cling to the rocks falling with you. If you are afraid of death, be afraid. The point
is to get with it, to let it take over-fear, ghosts, pains, transience, dissolution, and
all. And then comes the hitherto unbelievable surprise; you don't die because you were
never born. You had just forgotten who you are.

This strange paragraph is best understood with the idea presented in the first chapter:

> We do not "come into" this world; we come out of it, as leaves from a tree. As the ocean
"waves", the universe "peoples". Every individual is an expression of the whole real of
nature, a unique action of the total universe.

In this sense our approach to life is wrong. We are the results not the beginnings with
ends. Like our cells in our body, made for a specific purpose, destined to fulfill it or
die trying.

## Three - How to be a genuine fake

Collectively our society has been constructed throughout the generations to spellbind us
into believing that we are separate individuals ought to be free.

The rules of the social game are:

> The first rule of this game is that is not a game.
Everyone must play.
You must love us.
You must go on living.
Be yourself, but play a consistent and acceptable role.
Control yourself and be natural.
Try to be sincere.

Contradictions upon contradictions are the rules of the game. We ought to do things, but
these actions are only valuable if they are done sincerely. You must be free and you must
play by the rules. What is one left to do? That which is allowed. You cannot be free if you
are bound by the rules. These contradictions are built into us by society and by our
heritage. The precise reason the illusion can penetrate our minds so deeply is because we
are inseparable parts of our whole society and in fulfilling our quest to be separate
individuals we force the impossible. We try to be separate beings, when in essence we are
one.

> Nothing fails like success - because the self-imposed task of our society and all its
members is a contradictions: to force things to happen which are acceptable only when they
happen without force. This, in turn, arises from the definition of man as an independent
agent-in the universe but not of it-saddled with the job of bending the world to his will.

In our great contradiction we grow up, continuously sacrificing for the future "thing" that
might come that will be perfect, for which all this is worth the effort. Meanwhile we feel
desperate and alone, because we are trying to win a rigged game that should not be played.
We try to one up the universe, to conquer it whatever the cost. Even if we should fail in
doing so we believe our children will succeed, and the cycle continues forever. To fill the
void caused by our isolation we buy things that make us happy, and go to work to earn money
so we can buy things. However, most of us are so into the game that we work jobs that we
hate for the sole reason of earning money. We produce garbage, because the goal is to make
things quick and cheap so more money can be made. In turn everyone buys and makes garbage.
The ruse being who can fool who better, so that the winner can buy more things that would
make them happy?

The sliver of consciousness controlling our bodies has been taught so thoroughly that it
is separate from the harmonious whole that it perceives necessary things as enemies. Death
and decay as things to be feared, sorrow and loss to be avoided, instead of embracing
them as parts of the divine.

> For the enemy/friends of man are his pruners. They prevent him from destroying himself
by excess fertility, so that a person who dies of malaria or tuberculosis should be
honored at least as much as one who has died for his country in battle. he has made room
for the rest of us, and the bacteria which killed him should be saluted with proper
chivalry as an honorable foe.

These sentences are harsh, but deep inside we know them to be true. Non the less we have
been made into genuine fakes so successfully that we would cling to our freedom tormented
by perpetual suffering and inevitable end, instead of embracing our unity binding us
together with everything there is.

## Four - The world is your body

The world is your body or your body is the world. You are what you are and the world is
what the world is. Things occur in a way that causality rises as the side-effect of
observing parts of the whole. In this sense the cause of death is birth as everything
that lives eventually dies. They cannot be separated as matter cannot be separated from
space. Without space there cannot be something and without something there is no space.

> Apart from your brain, or some brain, the world is devoid of light, heat, weight
solidity, motion, space, time, or any other imaginable feature. All these phenomena are
interactions, or transactions, of vibrations with a certain arrangement of neurons. Thus
vibrations of light and heat from the sun do not actually become light or heat until they
interact with a living organism, just as no light-beams are visible in space unless
reflected by particles of atmosphere or dust. In other words, it "takes two" to make
anything happen.

That said you are what the environment needs and the environment is what needs you. Without
something to perceive it there might as well be nothing out there. Moreover an organism is
fully bound by the limits imposed on it by the environment. No organism exists without its
habitat and no environment exists without an organism either.

The advent of scientific thinking gave us the power and the know-how to bend the world to
our will, but in our conquest of becoming powerful we separated ourselves from the
inseparable. We became an utterly unimportant little germ in an unimaginably vast and
enduring universe.

Our lives are more than little flashes in the incomprehensible vastness of the cosmos.
If that were the case we might as well call it a day and get it over with. If the cause
of death is life then why even start it?

> It is not possible that this unity of knowledge, feeling and choice which you call your
own should have sprung into being from nothingness at a given moment not so long ago;
rather this knowledge, feeling and choice are essentially eternal and unchangeable and
numerically one in all men, nay in all sensitive beings. But no in this sense - that you
are a part, a piece, of an eternal, infinite being, an aspect or modification of it, as in
Spinoza-s pantheism. For we should have the same baffling question: which part, which
aspect are you? What, objectively, differentiates it from the others? No, but
inconceivable as it seems to ordinary reason, you - and all other conscious beings as
such - are all in all. Hence this life of yours which you are living is not merely a piece
of the entire existence, but is in a certain sense the whole; only this whole is not so
constituted that it can be surveyed in one single glance. - Erwin Schrödinger

If I am what is, what is ought to be, and I am you, then there isn't really no
difference between you or me or any conscious being. When I die, you take my place, when
you die I will take your place.

> Thus you can throw yourself flat on the ground, stretched out upon Mother Earth, with the
certain conviction that you are on with her and she with you. you are as firmly
established, as invulnerable as she, indeed a thousand times firmer and more invulnerable.
As surely as she will engulf you tomorrow, so surely will she bring you forth anew to new
striving and suffering. And not merely 'some day': now, today, every day she is bringing
you forth, not once but thousands upon thousands of times, just as every day she engulfs
you a thousand times over. For eternally and always there is only now, and the same now;
the present is the only thing that has no end. - Erwin Schrödinger

## Five - SO WHAT?

As we have seen previously an individual who is hoaxed into the illusion of being an
independent entity cannot convince themselves that they belong. This breeds quilt and
resentment. To mitigate these feelings the individual makes the most heroic efforts to
support equality, social change and progress. But because they themselves don't belong
and have no idea who they are, they are never satisfied.

> Nothing satisfies and individual incapable of enjoyment.

Life is not lived in the moment, but experiences are gulped down in the relentless pursuit
to satisfy the insatiable hunger. Days follow days, where the best we can remember is the
vague outline of the things that have happened and we have happened to perceive them as
important. Nothing seems to be enough, because things have no meaning at all. The
individual fails to see the double bind. The more they struggle to fill the void in
themselves the more they fail in doing so. The more they decide to go with the flow, the
more will they struggle not to struggle. Each direction is wrong. There is no way out and
only frustration ensues. The individual fails to develop a sense of love for themselves,
for everything there is. They become the specks of dust against the inevitable doom and to
fight back this feeling all effort is made to elevate themselves, but these efforts are
hollow.

> This is why moralistic preaching is such a failure: it breeds only cunning
hypocrites-people sermonized into shame, guilt, or fear, who thereupon force themselves to
behave as if they actually loved others, so that their "virtues" are often more
destructive, and arouse more resentment, than their "vices".

Nothing causes more destruction then the love of someone who cannot love or the help from
who does not sincerely wish for things to be better. The quest however has been set and
"I" depends on it, so it will be done. Whether you like it or not. Actions such as these
are ultimately aimed solely at the protection of the fragile "I". The hoax of separateness
pits the "I" against everything there is outside of it. To survive it has no other choice,
but to fight tooth and nail. Virtue rises without substance and violence is bred where
piece was intended.

The issue is not with the intentions, the issue is with who you think or where taught
you are. Simply there is no you.

> The only real "you" is the one that comes and goes, manifests and withdraws itself
eternally in and as every conscious being. For "you" is the universe looking at itself
from billions of points of view, points that come and go so that the vision is forever
new. What we see as death, empty space, or nothingness is only the trough between the
crests of this endlessly waving ocean. It is all part of the illusion that there should
seem to be something to be gained in the future, and that there is an urgent necessity to
go on and on until we get it. Yet just as there is no time but the present, and no one
except the all-and-everything, there is never anything to be gained - though the zest of
the game is to pretend that there is.

There is no difference between the perceived "I" and everything there is. It is true you
are nothing but a particle in a vast universe, but you are part of it. Without you the
waves of life would not be as they should be. You have a part to play in all this whole.
It just happens to be that the contribution of each player in this game of eternity is
infinitesimally small. This however does not mean that any player is without need.
Without your eyes there is no light, without your ears there is no sound, without death
there is no life and without pain there can be no joy. Everything, absolutely everything
matters. You need the people you hate so they keep you vigilant, you need the people you
love so they comfort you. You need the misfortunes of life so that you can appreciate what
is.

What has really changed then if you adopt this understanding and observe the dissolution
of the "I" as the mirage that it is? Absolutely nothing except that now, you are not alone.
You are not a soldier facing a foe that cannot be defeated, but a part of an endless game
played with yourself. You want to have this game as fascinating as it can be, so you play
your part as well as you can. You appreciate your hardships, your victories and sorrows,
because now you have the little twinkle in your eyes and you know this is why this is worth
playing. One second you are the villain, the other the saint. As no good story is
interesting without hardships your life isn't either.

> To play so as to be relaxed and refreshed for work is not to play, and no work is well
and finely done unless it, too, is a form of play.

You still make choices and you still make plans, but you know it is all just a game and
the part you play is just as important as any other. Even the mundane tasks of life can
be exceedingly interesting if they are played well. Cooking for example is a choir for some
who do not play it well, but some do and they become chefs. Being a bus driver could be a
tedious drag or a game of dodging and weaving. The number of games are endless and we all
must play some of them. What we have to decide is to play it the best we can and make it
interesting for "ourselves".
