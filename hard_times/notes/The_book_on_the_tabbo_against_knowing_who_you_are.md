# The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are - Alan Watts

# One

The chapter is about how people have lost their ability to know themselves.
The real self. As if it became a taboo to talk about who a given individual is.
Alan shows that the purpose of religions at their core is to show us that the individual
is the manifestation of the divine. We as individuals, the animals around us, the trees
and the sky, the good and the bad are all God. He stipulates that this has been lost 
throughout the ages, because people had to form groups of beliefs and when groups are 
formed the goal changes from improving all to a perpetual game of one-upmanship. My 
religion is more virtuous than yours etc. 
Not to mention that modern individuals can't even comprehend the archaic texts, with
outdated examples and stories. 

Without the redeeming nature of religion, of the belief in a higher good and value, the
individual is left with nothing but the realization that they are nothing more than little
tubes putting food in one end and excreting the result at another end. The tube make other
tubes so when their inevitable death finally arrives they don't fully disappear. 

> Our generation knows a cold hell, solitary confinement in this life, without a God to
damn or save it. Until man figures out the trap and hunts ... "the Ultimate Ground of
Being," he has no reason at all for his existence. Empty, finite, he knows only that he
will soon die. Since this life has no meaning, and he sees no future life, he is not
really a person but a victim of self-extinction. - T. George Harris

I think that, just that paragraph alone describes everything that is wrong in the world
today.

Although religion is very important to the author he points out that there is no single 
good answer and more importantly, even the pursuit for finding such an answer is false.

> Irrevocable commitment to any religion is not only intellectual suicide; it is positive
unfaith because it closes the mind to any new vision of the world. Faith is, above all,
open-ness -- an act of trust in the unknown.

## Two

Light and dark are necessary as without one there can be no other. This notion is
something many nowadays are familiar with. Alan argues that this isn't the end of the
story. They aren't just necessary to each other to exist they are
one thing. We just find it difficult to comprehend the unity, because we live (light) and
we die (dark). Death is something that we are raised/built to avoid. It inevitably becomes
something bad, something to be avoided. Therefore our lives turn into the metaphorical
battle between light and dark. Whatever may come light must win.

But with this approach we miss the big picture. Our minds get stuck being narrowly focused
on the parts without seeing the whole. Attention, similarly to life and death, necessitates
ignorance. One can only attend to somethings if others are ignored.

Life is full of wonders if ones allows themselves to see. 

> Real travel requires a maximum of unscheduled wandering, for there is no other way of
discovering surprises and marvels, which, as I see it, is the only good reason for not
staying at home.

Yes, it is dangerous to go outside, but it is just as dangerous to stay at home and do
nothing. With an apt example Alan demonstrates what it is to be afraid of death:

> Indeed, you were kicked off the edge of a precipice when you were born, and it's no help
to cling to the rocks falling with you. If you are afraid of death, be afraid. The point
is to get with it, to let it take over-fear, ghosts, pains, transience, dissolution, and
all. And then comes the hitherto unbelievable surprise; you don't die because you were
never born. You had just forgotten who you are.

This strange paragraph is best understood with the idea presented in the first chapter:

> We do not "come into" this world; we come out of it, as leaves from a tree. As the ocean
"waves", the universe "peoples". Every individual is an expression of the whole real of
nature, a unique action of the total universe.

In this sense our approach to life is wrong. We are the results not the beginnings with 
ends. Like our cells in our body, made for a specific purpose, destined to fulfill it or
die trying.
