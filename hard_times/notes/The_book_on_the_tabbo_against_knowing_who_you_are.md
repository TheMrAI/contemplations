# The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are - Alan Watts

# One

The chapter is about how people have lost their ability to know themselves.
The real self. As if it became a taboo to talk about who a given individual is.
Alan shows that the purpose of religions at their core is to show us that the individual
is the manifestation of the divine. We as individuals, the animals around us, the trees
and the sky, the good and the bad are all God. He stipulates that this has been lost 
throughout the ages, because people had to form groups of beliefs and when groups are 
formed the goal changes from improving all to a perpetual game of one-upmanship. My 
religion is more virtuous than yours etc. 
Not to mention that modern individuals can't even comprehend the archaic texts, with
outdated examples and stories. 

Without the redeeming nature of religion, of the belief in a higher good and value, the
individual is left with nothing but the realization that they are nothing more than little
tubes putting food in one end and excreting the result at another end. The tube make other
tubes so when their inevitable death finally arrives they don't fully disappear. 

> Our generation knows a cold hell, solitary confinement in this life, without a God to
damn or save it. Until man figures out the trap and hunts ... "the Ultimate Ground of
Being," he has no reason at all for his existence. Empty, finite, he knows only that he
will soon die. Since this life has no meaning, and he sees no future life, he is not
really a person but a victim of self-extinction. - T. George Harris

I think that, just that paragraph alone describes everything that is wrong in the world
today.

Although religion is very important to the author he points out that there is no single 
good answer and more importantly, even the pursuit for finding such an answer is false.

> Irrevocable commitment to any religion is not only intellectual suicide; it is positive
unfaith because it closes the mind to any new vision of the world. Faith is, above all,
open-ness -- an act of trust in the unknown.
