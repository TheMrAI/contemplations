# The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are - Alan Watts

## One - Inside information

The chapter is about how people have lost their ability to know themselves.
The real self. As if it became a taboo to talk about who a given individual is.
Alan shows that the purpose of religions at their core is to show us that the individual
is the manifestation of the divine. We as individuals, the animals around us, the trees
and the sky, the good and the bad are all God. He stipulates that this has been lost 
throughout the ages, because people had to form groups of beliefs and when groups are 
formed the goal changes from improving all to a perpetual game of one-upmanship. My 
religion is more virtuous than yours etc. 
Not to mention that modern individuals can't even comprehend the archaic texts, with
outdated examples and stories. 

Without the redeeming nature of religion, of the belief in a higher good and value, the
individual is left with nothing but the realization that they are nothing more than little
tubes putting food in one end and excreting the result at another end. The tube make other
tubes so when their inevitable death finally arrives they don't fully disappear. 

> Our generation knows a cold hell, solitary confinement in this life, without a God to
damn or save it. Until man figures out the trap and hunts ... "the Ultimate Ground of
Being," he has no reason at all for his existence. Empty, finite, he knows only that he
will soon die. Since this life has no meaning, and he sees no future life, he is not
really a person but a victim of self-extinction. - T. George Harris

I think that, just that paragraph alone describes everything that is wrong in the world
today.

Although religion is very important to the author he points out that there is no single 
good answer and more importantly, even the pursuit for finding such an answer is false.

> Irrevocable commitment to any religion is not only intellectual suicide; it is positive
unfaith because it closes the mind to any new vision of the world. Faith is, above all,
open-ness -- an act of trust in the unknown.

## Two - The game of black and white

Light and dark are necessary as without one there can be no other. This notion is
something many nowadays are familiar with. Alan argues that this isn't the end of the
story. They aren't just necessary to each other to exist they are
one thing. We just find it difficult to comprehend the unity, because we live (light) and
we die (dark). Death is something that we are raised/built to avoid. It inevitably becomes
something bad, something to be avoided. Therefore our lives turn into the metaphorical
battle between light and dark. Whatever may come light must win.

But with this approach we miss the big picture. Our minds get stuck being narrowly focused
on the parts without seeing the whole. Attention, similarly to life and death, necessitates
ignorance. One can only attend to somethings if others are ignored.

Life is full of wonders if ones allows themselves to see.

> Real travel requires a maximum of unscheduled wandering, for there is no other way of
discovering surprises and marvels, which, as I see it, is the only good reason for not
staying at home.

Yes, it is dangerous to go outside, but it is just as dangerous to stay at home and do
nothing. With an apt example Alan demonstrates what it is to be afraid of death:

> Indeed, you were kicked off the edge of a precipice when you were born, and it's no help
to cling to the rocks falling with you. If you are afraid of death, be afraid. The point
is to get with it, to let it take over-fear, ghosts, pains, transience, dissolution, and
all. And then comes the hitherto unbelievable surprise; you don't die because you were
never born. You had just forgotten who you are.

This strange paragraph is best understood with the idea presented in the first chapter:

> We do not "come into" this world; we come out of it, as leaves from a tree. As the ocean
"waves", the universe "peoples". Every individual is an expression of the whole real of
nature, a unique action of the total universe.

In this sense our approach to life is wrong. We are the results not the beginnings with
ends. Like our cells in our body, made for a specific purpose, destined to fulfill it or
die trying.

## Three - How to be a genuine fake

Collectively our society has been constructed throughout the generations to spellbind us
into believing that we are separate individuals ought to be free.

The rules of the social game are:

> The first rule of this game is that is not a game.
Everyone must play.
You must love us.
You must go on living.
Be yourself, but play a consistent and acceptable role.
Control yourself and be natural.
Try to be sincere.

Contradictions upon contradictions are the rules of the game. We ought to do things, but
these actions are only valuable if they are done sincerely. You must be free and you must
play by the rules. What is one left to do? That which is allowed. You cannot be free if you
are bound by the rules. These contradictions are built into us by society and by our
heritage. The precise reason the illusion can penetrate our minds so deeply is because we
are inseparable parts of our whole society and in fulfilling our quest to be separate
individuals we force the impossible. We try to be separate beings, when in essence we are
one.

> Nothing fails like success - because the self-imposed task of our society and all its
members is a contradictions: to force things to happen which are acceptable only when they
happen without force. This, in turn, arises from the definition of man as an independent
agent-in the universe but not of it-saddled with the job of bending the world to his will.

In our great contradiction we grow up, continuously sacrificing for the future "thing" that
might come that will be perfect, for which all this is worth the effort. Meanwhile we feel
desperate and alone, because we are trying to win a rigged game that should not be played.
We try to one up the universe, to conquer it whatever the cost. Even if we should fail in
doing so we believe our children will succeed, and the cycle continues forever. To fill the
void caused by our isolation we buy things that make us happy, and go to work to earn money
so we can buy things. However, most of us are so into the game that we work jobs that we
hate for the sole reason of earning money. We produce garbage, because the goal is to make
things quick and cheap so more money can be made. In turn everyone buys and makes garbage.
The ruse being who can fool who better, so that the winner can buy more things that would
make them happy?

The sliver of consciousness controlling our bodies has been taught so thoroughly that it
is separate from the harmonious whole that it perceives necessary things as enemies. Death
and decay as things to be feared, sorrow and loss to be avoided, instead of embracing
them as parts of the divine.

> For the enemy/friends of man are his pruners. They prevent him from destroying himself
by excess fertility, so that a person who dies of malaria or tuberculosis should be
honored at least as much as one who has died for his country in battle. he has made room
for the rest of us, and the bacteria which killed him should be saluted with proper
chivalry as an honorable foe.

These sentences are harsh, but deep inside we know them to be true. Non the less we have
been made into genuine fakes so successfully that we would cling to our freedom tormented
by perpetual suffering and inevitable end, instead of embracing our unity binding us
together with everything there is.
