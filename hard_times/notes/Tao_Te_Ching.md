# Tao Te Ching - Lau Tzu : [Translation by Derek Lin](https://taoism.net/tao/tao-te-ching-online-translation/)

The text itself isn't long. 81 chapters or verses each only a handful of lines
long, but the depth of the topic is outstanding. My cursory interpretation should
not be taken as a definitive show of understanding, rather an attempt at
information gathering.
A few topics or themes really stood out for me. Let's take the chapters one by one,
the text won't be shared here. For it refer to the source in the title. The author
has generously provided the access to the text for free.

The text isn't easy to understand even with the translation, but the ideas should
shine forth none the less.
Not every chapter will be interpreted as for some of them the meaning eludes me. 

## Chapter 1

Introduces the concept that the true Tao is something that cannot be named. As it
is the essence of nature, like Heaven and Earth itself. Trying to name it takes
away from it's glory. Things that can be named and those which cannot are born from
the same place. Named things are tangible, thing which cannot be named are divine.

## Chapter 2

Everything in the world has a duality. Good cannot exist without evil, beauty
cannot exist without the ugly, existence has no meaning without none existence.
This is the nature of things and as such a sage does not get attached to either
side of existence.

>"They work with myriad things but do not control
They create but do not possess
They act but do not presume
They succeed but do not dwell on success"

## Chapter 3

Desire to become more to have more corrupts the spirit and the heart. The issue is
with desiring things, not with getting them or producing them. Desire breeds greed
and confusion but if one can act without desire, without contrivance then the
options become limitless.

## Chapter 6

**Mystic Female**
Cannot understand what the chapter means.

## Chapter 7

The things that cannot be named, let's call them divine from here on, last forever
because they do not exist for themselves.
The sage achieves it's goals by serving others.

## Chapter 8

The Tao is like water. It benefits all without content and thus it is beyond
reproach itself.

## Chapter 9

Appreciate success, but do not chase it. Fame, positions of power and wealth bring
disasters upon their bearers. **Withdraw yourself - Tao of Heaven**

## Chapter 10

By letting go of things can they truly be grasped. Achieving is wrong if we allow
arrogance, having is wrong if it brings possessiveness. The act of moving forward
without getting corrupted is called the **Mystic Virtue**.

## Chapter 11

The value of a thing is not necessarily in what it is, but rather what it isn't.
A room, a container, a window all have their value in being empty.

## Chapter 12

Too much pleasure takes away the value. Abundant food is tasteless, abundant
beauty is without color. Focus on what is the most important and cherish that. A
home, warm food, health.

## Chapter 13 -- *Importance of the self*

The self is of the highest importance. It is the source of great pain or of great
strength. Existence itself is a misfortune if treated improperly, but if one learns
to value and love the self truly and deeply without judgement has the right to
inherit the world.

## Chapter 14 -- *Some things don't need to be understood to be of great value.*

The **Tao Axiom**. Colorless, formless, shapeless, began in nothing and it will
return to nothing after an eternity. It cannot be named, but it can be used to live
life properly.

## Chapter 16 -- *Acceptance is divine*

The self is safe when it has accepted itself and by doing so detached itself from
the named things (myriad in the text). When one returns to one's nature they
achieve tranquility. By looking inwards and finding the truth one reaches
constancy a form of clarity. Achieving this allows for radical acceptance
without judgement which is the manifestation of the divine.
