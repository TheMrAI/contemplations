# Tao Te Ching - Lau Tzu : [Translation by Derek Lin](https://taoism.net/tao/tao-te-ching-online-translation/)

The text itself isn't long. 81 chapters or verses each only a handful of lines
long, but the depth of the topic is outstanding. My cursory interpretation should
not be taken as a definitive show of understanding, rather an attempt at
information gathering.
A few topics or themes really stood out for me. Let's take the chapters one by one,
the text won't be shared here. For it refer to the source in the title. The author
has generously provided the access to the text for free.

The text isn't easy to understand even with the translation, but the ideas should
shine forth none the less.
Not every chapter will be interpreted as for some of them the meaning eludes me. 

## Chapter 1

Introduces the concept that the true Tao is something that cannot be named. As it
is the essence of nature, like Heaven and Earth itself. Trying to name it takes
away from it's glory. Things that can be named and those which cannot are born from
the same place. Named things are tangible, thing which cannot be named are divine.

## Chapter 2

Everything in the world has a duality. Good cannot exist without evil, beauty
cannot exist without the ugly, existence has no meaning without none existence.
This is the nature of things and as such a sage does not get attached to either
side of existence.

>"They work with myriad things but do not control
They create but do not possess
They act but do not presume
They succeed but do not dwell on success"

## Chapter 3

Desire to become more to have more corrupts the spirit and the heart. The issue is
with desiring things, not with getting them or producing them. Desire breeds greed
and confusion but if one can act without desire, without contrivance then the
options become limitless.

## Chapter 4-5

X

## Chapter 6

**Mystic Female**
Cannot understand what the chapter means.

## Chapter 7

The things that cannot be named, let's call them divine from here on, last forever
because they do not exist for themselves.
The sage achieves it's goals by serving others.

## Chapter 8

The Tao is like water. It benefits all without content and thus it is beyond
reproach itself.

## Chapter 9

Appreciate success, but do not chase it. Fame, positions of power and wealth bring
disasters upon their bearers. **Withdraw yourself - Tao of Heaven**

## Chapter 10

By letting go of things can they truly be grasped. Achieving is wrong if we allow
arrogance, having is wrong if it brings possessiveness. The act of moving forward
without getting corrupted is called the **Mystic Virtue**.

## Chapter 11

The value of a thing is not necessarily in what it is, but rather what it isn't.
A room, a container, a window all have their value in being empty.

## Chapter 12

Too much pleasure takes away the value. Abundant food is tasteless, abundant
beauty is without color. Focus on what is the most important and cherish that. A
home, warm food, health.

## Chapter 13 -- *Importance of the self*

The self is of the highest importance. It is the source of great pain or of great
strength. Existence itself is a misfortune if treated improperly, but if one learns
to value and love the self truly and deeply without judgement has the right to
inherit the world.

## Chapter 14 -- *Some things don't need to be understood to be of great value.*

The **Tao Axiom**. Colorless, formless, shapeless, began in nothing and it will
return to nothing after an eternity. It cannot be named, but it can be used to live
life properly.

## Chapter 15

X

## Chapter 16 -- *Acceptance is divine*

The self is safe when it has accepted itself and by doing so detached itself from
the named things (myriad in the text). When one returns to one's nature they
achieve tranquility. By looking inwards and finding the truth one reaches
constancy a form of clarity. Achieving this allows for radical acceptance
without judgement which is the manifestation of the divine.

## Chapter 17

The highest level of influence is achieved by not forcing. When the influence is so
subtle that the influenced feel as things went the natural way.

## Chapter 18

When the Tao is lost, intelligence takes it's place, but by loosing the divine,
chaos ensues.

## Chapter 19

> "Show plainness; hold simplicity
Reduce selfishness; decrease desires"

## Chapter 20

X

## Chapter 21

The Tao is unclear and it cannot be clear. It is all that is and should be, the
essence of life and within it lies faith.

## Chapter 22

The sage does not force things to be and that is why things come to be. "The one
who yields and remains whole". Things that are not meant to be will not be, that is
why one should yield and go where they need to go. Where is that can only be known
by becoming whole and returning to oneself.

## Chapter 23

Life should be embraced with all it's pains and pleasantries. Loss has to be
embraced for loss to embrace us, virtues need to be embraced before they can bless
us. One cannot get without giving and the Tao accepts all when it is accepted.

## Chapter 24

Similar message as in Chapter 22.

## Chapter 25

Similar to Chapter 21. The Tao is divine and thus cannot be fully understood.

## Chapter 26

X

## Chapter 27

A sage helps where it can and does not abandon anyone. A bad person is as necessary
for the good person as the good for the bad. The good person can teach the bad one
and the bad acts as a source of meaning for the good one.
More generally a problem needs it's solver. The solver must appreciate the problem
and vice-versa otherwise things get confused and one is left wondering of the
chaos. This is called the **Essential wonder**.

## Chapter 28

To live properly the two sides always have to be integrated at once. To act
rightly one must know how to be bad. To be masculine, one has to be able to be
feminine. To be boundless one has to know their limits. If things are kept in the
balance the world remains whole.

## Chapter 29

Arrogance, excess and extremes are far from balance and cannot be. Existence seeks
balance and whether by force or wit one tries to change this, they will inevitably
fail.

## Chapter 30-31

Force has to be applied only at need and only as much as absolutely necessary.
Control is unnatural and whoever seeking it will find themselves taxed in kind.
Nothing can be taken without paying the price.

## Chapter 33

The symbol of the self being as the base for real strength and peace appears again.
Similarly the act of serving others. Service for others allows one to not be
forgotten after they have died.

## Chapter 34-37

The Tao nourishes all the same, without judgement or desire. Whether bad or good
happens the Tao flows the same.
Acceptance is key. Not a thing can be forced. Whenever force is applied to opposite
outcome manifests, but by accepting, the barriers can be dissolved.

## Chapter 38

By controlling things we are misguided in everything we do and without the
stability of the peace of mind we loose control. Then trying to chase it more and
more only leads to chaos. When control is released one can see what is real, what
has real value.

## Chapter 39

The good and the bad are the two sides that belong together and only by achieving
oneness can stability be attained. However when something of value is achieved, one
mustn't forget that loss is necessary as well. Taking pride in what is takes away
it's value, especially as many things in life the result was perhaps nothing more
than luck.

## Chapter 40

The circularity of life and of everything. What begins, ends and what ends shall
begin.

## Chapter 41-43

Not forcing idea again.

## Chapter 44-46

Too much of anything, especially when sought takes the value away and prepares one
for failure.

## Chapter 47

Everything one needs is already within.

## Chapter 48

**Unattached action** is the key for progressing.

## Chapter 49

An open mind allows one to connect with everyone, to listen to everyone and by 
doing so accept them.

## Chapter 50

X

## Chapter 51

**Mystic Virtue** - "Produces but does not possess
Acts but does not flaunt
Nurtures but does not dominate"

## Chapter 52

X

## Chapter 53

The Tao is simple like a great river. Deviate to the banks and you are lost. Too
much or too little is bad the same way.

## Chapter 54

At the center of all things lies the individual. When the individual is put
together, the family can be put together, then the community and finally the whole
country. By constantly fixing bigger and more complex things, everything becomes
better.

## Chapter 55

Carry yourself properly and the world may not hurt you.

## Chapter 56

**Mystic Oneness** - Think before you speak and speak only when necessary, avoid
the extremes and find the answers.

## Chapter 57-59

The less force the better.

## Chapter 60

As the Tao is based on no force it cannot do harm.

## Chapter 61

Ask and it shall be given to you.

## Chapter 62

X

## Chapter 63

Be humble and do what you can right now. Do the best you can right now. It doesn't
have to be something big. Every small task eventually leads to the solution of
something great. Handle the completion of small tasks with just as much value as
the completion of big tasks would be.

## Chapter 64

Life is easy when things are going our way, but when they get hard many of us fail.
People start on long journeys without knowing the road or the end, so when they
would finally finish they get careless and fail. By desiring the end we loose the
sight of what is. Letting go of desire, letting go of unnecessary things will
redeem the people.

## Chapter 65

The **Mystic Virtue** lies in simplicity. Simple things are simple by definition.
They do not bring excess complexity to life and with less complexity, people
flourish.
