# Hard times - IN PRGOGRESS

Topic: How to handle hard times?

## Reading list and notes

After struggling to write a few lines about hard times I have realized that there
is much more left to be said about the topic and what I have done is nothing more
but a superficial scratch on the surface. What I have for the moment is true and
rings true to me, but now it seems evident there is not much more to say. Well, it
is alright. The first time I have ever embarked on this journey, it is supposed to
be difficult. Non the less the question interests me greatly and the work has to
be done.
To do a good job of the task at hand I have referred to the essay writing
guidelines at [Essay Writing Guide](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://jordanbpeterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Essay_Writing_Guide.docx). This has
illuminated me to the fact that I have no idea how to write properly and that I
should read a bit more about the topic, so that I have something to actually say.
First task is to collect the information. Listed a few books below that have
already inspired me and some that should be read and understood fully. What doing
this has shown me is that I seem to have accidentally started attacking the
problem from every side. The Psychological aspects, offering solutions from our understanding of human behavior, Military aspects or how a modern warrior would
handle life. Lastly from a Religious aspect. Based on generational knowledge and
wisdom that seems to have been lost in the modern world. Discarded for facts and
proofs, however they might be more important now than ever to glue humanities
fractured knowledge into one coherent whole.

In any case I have no idea yet what I am rambling about, but one thing seems to be
certain. There seems to be no single solution and to me that seems to indicate
that we haven't understood something as a species just yet. Most likely the truth
we seek is at the point where all, especially conflicting ideas intersect.

Write some notes, then outlines.

# Essay

This essay will be about the hard times, what they are and what one might be able
to do about them when they inevitably arrive. Why am I even bothering to
write about this? Multiple reasons really. Encountered them many times and
each time I have felt the same things over and over again. That there is
nothing I can do about the situation and this would inevitably put me down.
Loose hope, and with hope I would be lost. Sometimes turning trivial issues
into multiple days of suffering.
Turning a difficult time of life into an excruciating one. Secondly, I believe
everybody else has to suffer/struggle with difficulties at some point in their
lives. My personal battle against the corrupting influences of the struggle
which characterizes ordinary life are made that much more bearable if at least
through the sharing of my pain I can alleviate someone elses. Moreover, what
I have noticed, regretfully only recently, is that pain/suffering, as any
other negative emotion for that matter, is made that much more harder when
faced alone. A single willing, emphatic listener can change your whole
outlook on the situation. Thirdly, the material I have encountered so far on
the internet during these times, mainly motivational videos are good to get
the person out from the depths, but aren't good enough to keep things moving
sustainably or perhaps even more importantly, to help someone grow the
strength to actually deal with the issues causing the pain.
Fourthly, for the longest time I had the urge to
write about what I am thinking about. Waited for the "good enough" too long
and my ability to express ideas haven't improved in the least. Thus I would
not be able to write what I need to, whenever I need to, because I don't know how
to.
Here we are as always, selfish reasons mixed in with altruistic ones. This is
what I have learned about hard times.
## What are "hard times"
Alright what do I mean by hard times? For now lets say, the times in your life
when you knew perfectly well that something isn't alright and you felt hurt
about it and you either knew what you should do, but didn't have the energy or
faith to do so, or you had no idea what should be done. Depending on your
personality. To which category your specific situation belongs all depends on who
you are. Your past, your personality, your actual mood all affect how you
perceive the given situation. An event for one might look like the end of the
world if it manifests itself at an inopportune time, while to someone else it
might just be a bump in the road completely forgotten in about 15 minutes.
To make the abstract more tangible, the meta more real, I believe a few examples
are in order.

Maybe you are in school. There is nothing about it you like expect for a few
classes, but mostly you feel oppressed. Why should I be told what to do and
anyways and who cares about this or that subject? Is there anything I can do
about it? Not really. Everybody has to go to school, everybody has to get
educated, my parents are on my tail non stop to produce better grades. I feel
powerless to do anything, but to comply. My gut on the other hand is telling me
that this is wrong and something should be done about it, but I have no idea
about what to do.

You wake up in the morning, perhaps every morning and you realize that well, not
much reason do you see to get out of the bed. You ponder about it a little and
start asking the questions. How come I feel this way? Don't I like my job? What
has happened to me? Time passes with the questions and you suddenly realize well
you have no time for this, there are about a million things to do today. Go work,
train, walk the dog, cook something and the list goes on and on. While you are
busy living your "life" your mind has no time for more questions and the issue
seems to go away, but the next morning eventually comes and you wake up again.
You still have no idea what is wrong, but you are a little tired now. A little
less motivated and eventually you might even get used to it, to the point of even
forgetting the original question. The bugging problem seems to vanish, but
somehow things still seem hard.

Found the love of your life. Spent a few beautiful years together, working trough
your issues and trying to make each other better. You have your first child and
you are elated thinking about the future and the bright possibilities it might
hold. Then one uneventful day you get a call from the police or hospital telling
you that your partner and child have both died in a fatal car accident. In a
single second your past, your present and your future are completely obliterated.
Suddenly there is no up or down, left or right, nothing but a void you can't
imagine could ever be filled.

Perhaps you have an addiction. You drink alcohol or coffee, you smoke or do
something less obvious. Your obsession might be work, you just work too much. 60
hours or more maybe per week. Possibly you eat sweets a lot, especially when you
get stressed. On top of this you know your issue is present. You know perfectly
well that smoking a pack a day is ruining your health, or getting drunk all the
time is a waste of time. Knowing the issue and knowing that you should stop,
doesn't seem to bring you closer to your salvation. There is simply nothing you
seem to be able to do about it.
